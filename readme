Elements and Tags: Defines the structure of the webpage, such as headers, paragraphs, links, and forms.
Forms: Collects user input and sends it to the server or handles it with JavaScript.
Semantic HTML: Uses meaningful elements like <header>, <footer>, <article>, and <section> to improve accessibility and SEO.
2. CSS
CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is used for styling the HTML elements on the webpage. It controls the layout and appearance of the site.

Selectors: Targets HTML elements to apply styles.
Box Model: Defines the layout of elements including margins, borders, padding, and content.
Flexbox and Grid: Layout models for creating complex and responsive designs.
Media Queries: Applies styles based on device characteristics like screen size and orientation.
CSS Variables: Reusable values for colors, fonts, and other design elements to ensure consistency.
3. JavaScript
JavaScript is a programming language that enables interactive and dynamic features on web pages.

DOM Manipulation: Interacts with and modifies the HTML elements on the page.
Event Handling: Responds to user actions such as clicks, form submissions, and key presses.
AJAX/Fetch API: Makes asynchronous requests to the server to retrieve or send data without reloading the page.
Firebase Integration: Uses Firebase SDK to handle authentication, data storage, and real-time updates.
